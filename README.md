# POPIAttnNet is a Biological prediction tool
Prediction of immunogenicity of the MHC-binding peptide
POPI is a prediction model for predicting the immunogenicity of HLA- binding peptides, which uses Bi-LSTM and attention mechanism to perform two-class prediction, i.e. immunogenicity and non-immunogenicity.

The script of the  POPIAttnNet is Python3.7, and Tensorflow2.3.0 is used to build the model.
